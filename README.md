# Personal Life Tracker

An app that I will use to track daily and monthly goals, broken down into three distinct categories.

## Categories
-  Calories
-  Exercise
-  Budget Spent

## This starter includes:
- Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript
- Tailwind (utility classes) â€” minimal custom styles in `globals.css`
- React Query for server state
- Supabase client + SQL schema with RLS and RPC helpers
- Pages: `Dashboard` and `Daily Log` with quick-add forms
